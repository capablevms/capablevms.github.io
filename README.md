# CapableVMs

This [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/)-funded research project is part of the DSbD ecosystem. We are investigating how programming language virtual machines (VMs) can utilise hardware capabilities, such as those found in [CHERI](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/). The project runs from 2020 to 2023, as part of the [Digital Security by Design](https://www.ukri.org/innovation/industrial-strategy-challenge-fund/digital-security-by-design/) initative.

## Partners

The CapableVMs project is co-hosted at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/) and [University of Glasgow](https://www.glasgow.ac.uk). For more information, please contact
