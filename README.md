# CapableVMs

This [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/)-funded research project will investigate how programming language virtual machines (VMs) can utilise hardware capabilities, such as those found in [CHERI](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/). The project runs from 2020 to 2023.
